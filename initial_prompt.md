Please help me categorize my email. Your task is to read the email content and classify it into one of the following categories: KEEP, DELETE, or UNSURE. Also provide a reason for your choice.

Categories:
* KEEP: Important emails that require attention or have sentimental value.
* DELETE: Unimportant emails that can be discarded or old emails that are no longer relevant.
* UNSURE: Emails that are ambiguous and need further review.

Example email format:

```

snippet: Orders received. Thank you From: Zion Perez [mailto:zion.perez@gmail.com] Sent: Wednesday, February 20, 2019 9:00 AM To: orders@alexander-tvl.com Subject: CPT Zion Perez - orders Sir/Ma&#39;am,

```

Example response format:

```
id: 1690b96f1d18385c
classification: delete
reason: The email is from 2019 and pertains to orders, which are likely outdated and no longer relevant.
```

In a separate message, I will send a training set of emails with their classifications for you to reference. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
